AR VR App

I tried to develop the user intereactive android app for guiding about tourism historical important places in India.

In this Project the Map of Karnataka state is used as a marker or image target for augmenting the 3D models of tourism points in different places in Karnataka state.

I created Dashboard, Button interface, AR messages windows, Audio sources and Animations for 3D models of respective tourism places.
